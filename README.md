## General info

Each of the scripts is used to realize another task.
Scripts was written due to personally requirements.
You can use it, modify and do everything that you want.


## gdrivemounter

Script was prepared to be used together with google-drive-ocalmfuse
package. Because gdo has no service-agent, script can be easily adapted
as base for service daemon. It can be also used as separate script, to
manually mount and umount multiple (or single) drives.

For more info check source.

## vpsconfigurator

Script is used to automate initial configuration of VPS.
It creates the new user, set password and install necessary software.
Still in development to exclude as much as possible manually typing.
